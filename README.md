Example GRPC service for testing and validating various bits of GRPC functionality on the FL0 platform.

Running it is as simple as executing `cargo run` in the root directory.
By default, it will attempt to bind to port `8080` on `localhost` (`127.0.0.1`) however this behaviour can be overridden with the `PORT` and `ENVIRONMENT` variables. Setting `ENVIRONMENT` to `PROD` will cause it to bind to `0.0.0.0` instead.
